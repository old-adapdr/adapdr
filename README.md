# WhoAmI? and how to navigate my profile üëç
For the month of January I will be reviewing, archiving and in general (re)setting up my profile.

This is being done for the following _three_ reasons:
1. Give visibility to active projects
2. Delete, hide or update repositories that may spread bad development practises for Python and other languages.
3. Better showcase _good and standardized_ practises for generic application development.
