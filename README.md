# WhoAmI & How to navigate my profile
Welcome to my GitHub Profile 🎉

I'm a (Python)Developer & OpsGuy 👋 with a passion for creating simple, efficient and scalable solutions. In practise this means I ❤️ testing and developing in new and exciting technologies. After all, if there is a more efficient or cleaner way of doing something... why not 🤔?


This repository is inteded as a starting point for navigating all of my techy stuff 🤓💻 I'm always working on something for someone,so this page will primarily be updated as time allows across work & projects 💪
